# Energy_Balance_Model
#Model code in Matlab for the Goodwin and Williams (resubmitted in 2023) paper "On the Arctic Amplification of surface warming in a conceptual climate model" submitted to Physica D: non-linear processes special issue on climate modelling.

#To run the code, download all files and extract the archives in the "Cloud_Data" folder.
#In Matlab, run the CloudEBM_model_ECS_Steady_State.m file (using command CloudEBM_model_ECS_Steady_State when in the directory with that file).
#This will run the Energy Balance Model and produce a series of figures from the paper submission. 
#In these figures, the HadCRUT5 data is not plotted, as this data is not supplied here. The figures produced are not annotated or labelled.
